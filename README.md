This is the repository for the paper "Domain Adaptive Detection of MAVs: A Benchmark and Noise Suppression Network".

The link to the dataset present in the paper: https://westlakeu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zhao_lab_westlake_edu_cn/Er96hmAJKZdKrjlBAMPLuFoBp3Gnuwy7k0Phqv8RZkO5sw?e=6FIzeZ.

This dataset includes the simulation images and realistic images. All the labels are in the YOLO format. Please refer https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 for details. 

The code for mAP evaluation adopts a standard evaluation tool:https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/lib/datasets/voc_eval.py instead of the code provided by yolov5 for fairness.



If you have any problem when using this dataset, please feel free to contact: [zhangyin@westlake.edu.cn](mailto:zhangyin@westlake.edu.cn).
